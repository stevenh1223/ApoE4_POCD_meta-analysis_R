# APOE4 and Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction (POCD) – Meta-Analysis

This repository contains R code and data for a meta-analysis assessing the association between the APOE4 gene and short- and medium-term postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD).

## 📊 Statistical Methods Used

- **Random-effects meta-analysis** using `meta` and `metafor` packages
- **Subgroup analysis** by type of surgery
- **Funnel plot** with contour enhancement to assess publication bias
- **Egger’s regression test** to statistically test for publication bias

## 🧠 Key Skills Demonstrated

- Effect size estimation and heterogeneity quantification
- Visualization: forest plots, funnel plots
- Hypothesis testing and publication bias analysis
- R programming: `meta`, `metafor` packages

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open `ApoE4.R` in **RStudio**
2. Make sure the required packages are installed:
   ```r
   install.packages("meta")
   install.packages("metafor")
   ```
3. Run the script to perform meta-analysis and visualize results.

## 📈 Funnel Plot Example

To generate:
```r
funnel(res, yaxis = "seinv", level = c(90, 95, 99), shade = c("white", "gray55", "gray75"))
```

To save:
```r
png("funnel_plot.png", width = 800, height = 600)
funnel(res, yaxis = "seinv", level = c(90, 95, 99), shade = c("white", "gray55", "gray75"))
dev.off()
```
